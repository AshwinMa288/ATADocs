Azure Advanced Threat Protection monitors information generated from your organization's Active Directory, network activities and event activities to detect suspicious activity. The monitored activity information enables Azure ATP to help you determine the validity of each potential threat and correctly triage and respond.

In the case of a valid threat, or **true positive**, Azure ATP enables you to discover the scope of breach for each incident, investigate which entities are involved, and determine how to remediate them.

The information monitored by Azure ATP is presented in the form of activities. Azure ATP currently supports monitoring of the following activity types:
