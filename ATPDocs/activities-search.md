# Azure ATP monitored activities search and filter 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Threat protection product names from Microsoft are changing. Read more about this and other updates [here](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/?p=91813).  Weâ€™ll be updating names in products and in the docs in the near future.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure ATP features explained on this page are also accessible using the new [portal](https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com).

Activities detected by Azure ATP on your network can be searched and filtered for easy drill-down and organization during your research and investigation into security alerts.  

From the Azure ATP timeline, select any entity in your network (DC, machine, or user) as the filter access point. Next, select to filter by the **Security Alert**, **Activity** type, or any combination. Once the filter is applied, the threat timeline of the entity is updated with the filtered information. Your filtered alerts and activities can also be downloaded to continue your investigation or tracking in other tools.

 4. To download the filtered activities, click **Download activities** and select the date range for your download report. 
 5. To reset the entity timeline to display all alerts and activities, click **Reset** or close the filter.
