# Compromised credential alerts

Typically, cyber-attacks are launched against any accessible entity, such as a low-privileged user, and then quickly move laterally until the attacker gains access to valuable assets â€“ such as sensitive accounts, domain administrators, and highly sensitive data. [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] identifies these advanced threats at the source throughout the entire attack kill chain and classifies them into the following phases:

1. [Reconnaissance](reconnaissance-alerts.md)
1. **Compromised credential**
1. [Lateral Movements](lateral-movement-alerts.md)
1. [Domain dominance](domain-dominance-alerts.md)
1. [Exfiltration](exfiltration-alerts.md)

To learn more about how to understand the structure, and common components of all [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] security alerts, see [Understanding security alerts](understanding-security-alerts.md). For information about **True positive (TP)**, **Benign true positive (B-TP)**, and **False positive (FP)**, see [security alert classifications](understanding-security-alerts.md#security-alert-classifications).
