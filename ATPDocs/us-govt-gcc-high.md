# Microsoft Defender for Identity for US Government offerings

The [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] GCC High offering uses the same underlying technologies and capabilities as the commercial instance of [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)]. A list of feature variances can be found in the [Service Description](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-azure-atp-govt-service-description).

## Get started with US Government offerings

The [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] GCC, GCC High, and Department of Defense (DoD) offerings are built on the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud and are designed to inter-operate with Microsoft 365 GCC, GCC High, and DoD. Use [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] public documentation as a [starting point](install-step1.md) for deploying and operating the service and refer to the [Service Description](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-mdi-govt-service-description), which details all changes from functionality or features specific to the GCC, GCC High, and DoD environments.

## Required connectivity settings

Use [this link](prerequisites.md#ports) to configure the minimum internal ports necessary that the Defender for Identity sensor requires.

## How to migrate from commercial to GCC

1. Have your Microsoft contact send an internal email with the tenant details to [AskGCC@microsoft.com](mailto:AskGCC@microsoft.com)
2. Go to the GCC portal for Defender for Identity: `https://portal.gcc.atp.azure.com`
3. Create a new instance of Defender for Identity
4. Configure a Directory Service account
5. Download the new sensor agent package and copy the workspace key
6. Make sure sensors have access to *.gcc.atp.azure.com (directly or through proxy)
7. Uninstall existing sensor agents from the domain controllers
8. (Optionally) [install the npcap driver](technical-faq.yml#how-do-i-download-and-install-the-npcap-driver)
9. [Reinstall sensors with the new workspace key](install-step4.md#install-the-sensor)
10. Migrate any settings after the initial sync (use the two portals to compare)
11. Eventually, delete the previous workspace (historic data will be lost)

>[!NOTE]
> No data is migrated from the commercial service.
> 
> If you also have Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps deployed, it should be migrated before you start the Defender for Identity migration.

## Feature parity with the commercial environment

Unless otherwise specified, new feature releases, including preview features, documented in [What's new with Defender for Identity](whats-new.md), will be available in GCC, GCC High, and DoD environments within 90 days of release in the Defender for Identity commercial environment. Preview features may not be supported in the GCC, GCC High, and DoD environments. Refer to the [Service Description](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-mdi-govt-service-description) for a list of functionality or features specific to the GCC, GCC High, and DoD environments.
