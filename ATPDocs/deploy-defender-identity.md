# Deploy Microsoft Defender for Identity with Microsoft 365 Defender

The deployment of Microsoft Defender for Identity with Microsoft 365 Defender has two phases - preparation and deployment.

This article will outline the steps in each phase, and also provide instructions for special scenarios.

## Start using Microsoft 365 Defender

To begin the deployment of Defender for Identity, sign in to the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com). From the navigation menu, select any item, such as **Incidents & alerts**, **Hunting**, **Action center**, or **Threat analytics** to initiate the onboarding process.

You'll then be given the option to deploy supported services, including Microsoft Defender for Identity. When you go to the Defender for Identity settings, the required cloud components will be auto-provisioned.
