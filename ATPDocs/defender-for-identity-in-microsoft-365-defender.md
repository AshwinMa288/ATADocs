# Microsoft Defender for Identity in Microsoft 365 Defender

Microsoft's portfolio of security products has grown vastly over the last few years. We're making the next step in our *Extended Detection and Response* (XDR) journey and are bringing together these best-in-class security products to enable cross-domain analysis and holistic response from a single dashboard. We're now striving to provide a unified administration and operating experience for our products to fully unlock the value of them working together.  This will help improve efficiency within security operations and help keep organizations more secure. This has already started with [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint) and [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security).

Microsoft Defender for Identity already contributes data into the incidents and alerts that [Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender) presents. Having identity focused information is key to correlating alerts from the other products. It provides some unique context to this process. Taking this further, we're now introducing Defender for Identity features, functions, and capabilities to the [Microsoft 365 security center](/microsoft-365/security/defender/overview-security-center) so that you see more detailed investigations, analysis and indeed, complete resolution and response from a single place.

The timelines for the individual workstreams relating to this task can be tracked on the public [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=Microsoft%20Defender%20for%20Identity).

Based on the dates provided on the roadmap, we'll be investing in the deployment of these features in the Microsoft 365 security center so it will be the best place to experience and work with Microsoft Defender for Identity.
